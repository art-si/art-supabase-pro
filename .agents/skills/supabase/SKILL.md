# Supabase

## Core Principles

### Project tenant-scope invariant

For `art-supabase-pro`, apply this invariant to every table, view, RPC, Edge Function, and Data API provider that handles tenant-owned business data:

- Only platform super administrators can select `全部租户` or another tenant in the application header. Ordinary users and tenant administrators are always bound to their authenticated tenant, including when they forge `x-art-tenant-scope`.
- `app_private.current_read_tenant_id()` returns the ordinary user's tenant, the concrete header tenant for platform-selected, and `NULL` for platform-all. Test `NULL` as all tenants with `app_private.tenant_in_current_read_scope(tenant_id)` or an equivalent null-safe predicate. Never compare `tenant_id = current_read_tenant_id()` directly.
- Do not implement SELECT as `is_platform_super() OR tenant_id = current_user_tenant_id()`: the super branch leaks all tenants after a concrete tenant is selected. Apply the canonical read predicate and keep separate permission/ownership conditions.
- `SECURITY DEFINER` readers bypass RLS and therefore must repeat the canonical read predicate in every base query, count, option list, recursive CTE, and related-record lookup.
- Platform-all remains writable for authorized platform super administrators. Bind an existing-row mutation to that row's tenant and a child creation to its parent tenant. A root create/import in platform-all defaults to the authenticated administrator's platform tenant unless an explicit target is supplied; a concrete header selection supplies the selected tenant. Do not require a header switch when the target is already unambiguous.
- Preserve `canonical_platform_super_write` on every RLS-enabled public table with `tenant_id`, or provide a reviewed equivalent that grants the same authenticated platform-super write path. Do not derive this authority from `x-art-tenant-scope`; the header selects a view, while `is_platform_super()` grants authority.
- Do not treat login bootstrap identity as an ordinary business list. The current `sys_user` row identified by `auth_user_id = auth.uid()` must remain readable even while a valid, stale, or invalid tenant scope is persisted; scope reads of other users normally. A global restrictive tenant policy on `sys_user` is invalid because it can turn a successful Auth login into `PGRST116` during profile loading.
- Verify platform-all, platform-selected, ordinary-own, and forged-header ordinary behavior after every tenant-boundary migration. For mutation changes, also verify platform-all create/edit with an explicit or inherited target tenant.

### Project database delivery policy

For `art-supabase-pro`, do not create, fetch, reconstruct, retain, or publish per-version migration SQL files under `supabase/migrations` (or another directory). This project intentionally uses reviewed direct database execution instead of repository-managed migration artifacts. A consolidated migration-history dump inside a Git-ignored project-transfer backup is allowed for restoring another Supabase project.

- Do not run `supabase migration new`, `supabase migration fetch`, `supabase db pull`, `supabase db push`, or MCP `apply_migration`.
- Apply approved schema, RLS, function, trigger, grant, comment, seed, and scheduler changes directly with MCP `execute_sql`; use `supabase db query --linked` only as the documented fallback when MCP is unavailable.
- Before a production mutation, take and verify a recoverable backup, run the SQL inside `BEGIN`/`ROLLBACK` against the target when the operation supports transactional validation, and inspect dependencies and cross-tenant violations. Then execute the reviewed statement directly and immediately run post-change assertions, lint/advisors, and the relevant application tests.
- Keep durable audit evidence in architecture/runbook documentation and ordinary automated tests, not in migration SQL. Never repopulate `supabase/migrations` merely to align local and remote migration history.
- Existing remote migration-history rows are operational history only; do not materialize them as individual SQL files in the workspace.

**1. Supabase changes frequently — verify against changelog and current docs before implementing.**
Do not rely on training data for Supabase features. Function signatures, config.toml settings, and API conventions change between versions.

First, fetch `https://supabase.com/changelog.md` (a lightweight summary index — not a heavy pull), scan for `breaking-change` tags relevant to your task, and follow the linked page for any that apply. Then look up the relevant topic using the documentation access methods below.

**2. Verify your work.**
After implementing any fix, run a test query to confirm the change works. A fix without verification is incomplete.

**3. Recover from errors, don't loop.**
If an approach fails after 2-3 attempts, stop and reconsider. Try a different method, check documentation, inspect the error more carefully, and review relevant logs when available. Supabase issues are not always solved by retrying the same command, and the answer is not always in the logs, but logs are often worth checking before proceeding.

**4. Exposing tables to the Data API:** Depending on the user's [Data API settings](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/<ref>/integrations/data_api/settings), newly created tables may not be automatically exposed via the Data (REST) API. If this is the case, `anon` and `authenticated` roles will need to be explicitly granted access.

> Note that this is separate from RLS, which controls which _rows_ are visible once a table is accessible, not whether the table is accessible at all.

When a user reports a SQL-created table is unexpectedly inaccessible, check their Data API settings and whether the roles have been granted access via explicit `GRANT` SQL. When granting public (`anon`/`authenticated`) access, always enable RLS too. See [Exposing a Table to the Data API](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/api/securing-your-api.md) for the full setup workflow.

**5. RLS in exposed schemas.**
Enable RLS on every table in any exposed schema, which includes `public` by default. This is critical in Supabase because tables in exposed schemas can be reachable through the Data API when the `anon`/`authenticated` roles have access (see [Exposing a Table to the Data API](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/api/securing-your-api.md)). For private schemas, prefer RLS as defense in depth. After enabling RLS, create policies that match the actual access model rather than defaulting every table to the same `auth.uid()` pattern.

**6. Security checklist.**
When working on any Supabase task that touches auth, RLS, views, storage, or user data, run through this checklist. These are Supabase-specific security traps that silently create vulnerabilities:

- **Auth and session security**
  - **Never use `user_metadata` claims in JWT-based authorization decisions.** In Supabase, `raw_user_meta_data` is user-editable and can appear in `auth.jwt()`, so it is unsafe for RLS policies or any other authorization logic. Store authorization data in `raw_app_meta_data` / `app_metadata` instead.
  - **Deleting a user does not invalidate existing access tokens.** Sign out or revoke sessions first, keep JWT expiry short for sensitive apps, and for strict guarantees validate `session_id` against `auth.sessions` on sensitive operations.
  - **If you use `app_metadata` or `auth.jwt()` for authorization, remember JWT claims are not always fresh until the user's token is refreshed.**

- **API key and client exposure**
  - **Never expose the `service_role` or secret key in public clients.** Prefer publishable keys for frontend code. Legacy `anon` keys are only for compatibility. In Next.js, any `NEXT_PUBLIC_` env var is sent to the browser.

- **RLS, views, and privileged database code**
  - **Views bypass RLS by default.** In Postgres 15 and above, use `CREATE VIEW ... WITH (security_invoker = true)`. In older versions of Postgres, protect your views by revoking access from the `anon` and `authenticated` roles, or by putting them in an unexposed schema.
  - **UPDATE requires a SELECT policy.** In Postgres RLS, an UPDATE needs to first SELECT the row. Without a SELECT policy, updates silently return 0 rows — no error, just no change.
  - **`auth.role()` is deprecated — use the `TO` clause instead.** Supabase has deprecated `auth.role()` in favour of specifying the target role directly on the policy with `TO authenticated` or `TO anon`. Beyond deprecation, `auth.role() = 'authenticated'` breaks silently when anonymous sign-ins are enabled, because anonymous users carry the `authenticated` Postgres role and pass the check regardless of whether the user is genuinely signed in.
    ```sql
    -- Deprecated (do not use)
    create policy "example" on table_name for select
    using ( auth.role() = 'authenticated' );
    ```
  - **`TO authenticated` alone is authentication without authorization (BOLA / IDOR).** Using `TO authenticated` only checks the role — it does not restrict which rows a user can access. The correct pattern combines `TO authenticated` with an ownership predicate in `USING`:
    ```sql
    create policy "example" on table_name for select
    to authenticated
    using ( (select auth.uid()) = user_id );
    ```
  - **UPDATE policies require both `USING` and `WITH CHECK`.** Without `WITH CHECK`, a user can reassign a row's `user_id` to another user:
    ```sql
    create policy "example" on table_name for update
    to authenticated
    using ( (select auth.uid()) = user_id )
    with check ( (select auth.uid()) = user_id );
    ```
  - **`SECURITY DEFINER` functions bypass RLS.** A `SECURITY DEFINER` function runs with its creator's privileges — typically a role with `bypassrls` (e.g., `postgres`). Never add `SECURITY DEFINER` to resolve a permission error; it silently removes access control without fixing the underlying cause. Prefer `SECURITY INVOKER`.
  - **`SECURITY DEFINER` functions in `public` are callable by all roles.** Postgres grants `EXECUTE` to `PUBLIC` by default for every new function, so any `SECURITY DEFINER` function in `public` is a public API endpoint callable by `anon` and `authenticated` (which inherit from `PUBLIC`) without any additional grant. When `SECURITY DEFINER` is genuinely needed (e.g., bypassing RLS on an internal lookup table), keep the function in a non-exposed schema, always include an `auth.uid()` check in the function body, and run `supabase db advisors` after making changes.

- **Storage access control**
  - **Storage upsert requires INSERT + SELECT + UPDATE.** Granting only INSERT allows new uploads but file replacement (upsert) silently fails. You need all three.

- **Dependency and supply-chain security**
  - **Always pin package versions and commit lockfiles** when installing Supabase packages (`supabase-js`, `@supabase/ssr`, `supabase-py`, etc.). See the [npm security guide](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/security/npm-security.md) for the full checklist.

## Supabase CLI

Always discover commands via `--help` — never guess. The CLI structure changes between versions.

```bash
supabase --help                    # All top-level commands
supabase <group> --help            # Subcommands (e.g., supabase db --help)
supabase <group> <command> --help  # Flags for a specific command
```

**Supabase CLI Known gotchas:**

- `supabase db query` requires **CLI v2.79.0+** → use MCP `execute_sql` or `psql` as fallback
- `supabase db advisors` requires **CLI v2.81.3+** → use MCP `get_advisors` as fallback
- This project forbids migration SQL artifacts; follow the project database delivery policy above instead of generating a migration.

**Version check and upgrade:** Run `supabase --version` to check. For CLI changelogs and version-specific features, consult the [CLI documentation](https://supabase.com/docs/reference/cli/introduction) or [GitHub releases](https://github.com/supabase/cli/releases).

## Supabase MCP Server

For setup instructions, server URL, and configuration, see the [MCP setup guide](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/getting-started/mcp).

**Troubleshooting connection issues** — follow these steps in order:

1. **Check if the server is reachable:**
   `curl -so /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" https://mcp.supabase.com/mcp`
   A `401` is expected (no token) and means the server is up. Timeout or "connection refused" means it may be down.

2. **Check `.mcp.json` configuration:**
   Verify the project root has a valid `.mcp.json` with the correct server URL. If missing, create one pointing to `https://mcp.supabase.com/mcp`.

3. **Authenticate the MCP server:**
   If the server is reachable and `.mcp.json` is correct but tools aren't visible, the user needs to authenticate. The Supabase MCP server uses OAuth 2.1 — tell the user to trigger the auth flow in their agent, complete it in the browser, and reload the session.

## Supabase Documentation

Before implementing any Supabase feature, find the relevant documentation. Use these methods in priority order:

1. **MCP `search_docs` tool** (preferred — returns relevant snippets directly)
2. **Fetch docs pages as markdown** — any docs page can be fetched by appending `.md` to the URL path.
3. **Web search** for Supabase-specific topics when you don't know which page to look at.

## Making and Committing Schema Changes

**To make schema changes, use `execute_sql` (MCP) or `supabase db query` (CLI).** These run reviewed SQL directly on the database without creating local migration artifacts.

Do NOT use `apply_migration` to change a local database schema — it writes a migration history entry on every call, which means you can't iterate, and `supabase db diff` / `supabase db pull` will produce empty or conflicting diffs. If you use it, you'll be stuck with whatever SQL you passed on the first try.

**For `art-supabase-pro`, do not generate or commit a migration file.** When the direct change is ready:

1. **Run advisors** → `supabase db advisors` (CLI v2.81.3+) or MCP `get_advisors`. Fix any issues.
2. **Review the Security Checklist above** if your changes involve views, functions, triggers, or storage.
3. **Transactionally validate** → execute the reviewed SQL inside `BEGIN` / `ROLLBACK` against the target database when supported.
4. **Apply directly and verify** → execute through MCP `execute_sql` or the CLI fallback, then run post-change assertions and record the outcome in the relevant runbook or audit document.
